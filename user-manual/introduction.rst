Introduction

Dear user, welcome to **Gisquick** documentation!
Gisquick is an open source geospatial data publishing platform developed for QGIS projects.
Explore more to see how easy yet powerful is working in Gisquick.

There are few topics you might be interested in. Firstly, if you are about to **publish** your **QGIS**
**project online**, see chapter **1** to **4**.Please note that there are two alternative ways of publishing
so the choice must be made which one to follow (chapter **2** or **3**). Together with every released project,
web map service (**WMS**) is created and can be subsequently modified.

If you wonder **what does the output look like** or **which features are involved**, check chapter **5**.

Browse chapter **6** for **metadata of example datasets** which were used for documentation.

If you plan to **operate Gisquick publication server** on your own hardware, see chapter **7**.
List of chapters follows below.

1. **Creating account**
-----------------------
It is necessary to create an account.

2. **Traditional publishing**
-----------------------------
Whether to follow traditional way of publishnig depends only on user. Nevertheless, both ways have its
pros & cons. Definitely, the traditional way is a good point to start, since it uses the Gisquick plugin
|plugin| , which has been tested for a long time.
Anyway, please read short description of experimental way either to consider which one to follow.

2.1 **Preparing project**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
How to proceed in QGIS.

2.2 **Uploading project**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
How to upload prepared project created in plugin to server.

3. **Experimental publishing**
------------------------------
Experimental way of publishing is kind of innovative approach to Gisquick. New plugin |plugin2| is involved.
In comparison to traditional way, it allows user to easily edit published projects; every change made in
project in QGIS can be reflected in Gisquick by activating plugin which enables user to compare local and cloud
project's folders, layer by layer.

3.1 **Preparing project**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
How to proceed in QGIS.

3.2 **Uploading project**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
How to connect to the server directly from QGIS and upload project.

4. **Releasing project**
------------------------
Last few steps of publishing process are identical for both traditional and experimental way.

5. **User interface**
---------------------
Each component involved in UI is decribed in this chapter.

6. **Sample datasets**
----------------------
Basic information about datasets which were used for documentation.

7. **Other**
------------
Interesting links to video tutorials, used technologies or source code.
