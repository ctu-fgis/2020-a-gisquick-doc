User Interface
==============

Gisquick User Interface (UI) is designed to be simple,
self-explanatory, and responsive. The major part is occupied of *map
canvas* (``1``). On the left is located *content menu* (``2``) which
is possible to hide by button on its right side (``3``). Corners of
map canvas are filled by (from left-bottom corner, clockwise) by *map
scale* (``4``), *tools menu* (``5``), *user menu* (``6``) and *zoom
menu* (``7``). In the bottom part is located statusbar showing current
scale, projection and map coordinates of the cursor (``8``).

   Gisquick UI explanation.
----------
Print tool
----------

The main idea is, that once print is activated in Gisquick, it will
download raw print output from QGIS Server using GetPrint request and
will allow interactive visualization of map content directly in this
template.  One can zoom, pan and rotate map and see exactly how the
result will look like.  To get the better idea, see video below.
