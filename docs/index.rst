Gisquick is an open source geospatial data publishing platform
developed for rapid sharing `QGIS <http://qgis.org>`__ projects on the
web.

Gisquick provides responsive web design, legend, or identification
possibilities. It allows creating topics from layers list, adding base
and overlay layers, attribute table data filtering, measuring
coordinates, length or area, and handy project printing from
ready-to-use web application.
 
To get the better idea what Gisquick is, see video below.

.. note:: Gisquick has been originally developed for `GIS.lab
   <http://web.gislab.io>`__ system with aim to produce generally
   usable web client interface. Later it was separated into a new
   independent project usable with or without GIS.lab
   infrastructure.
