Gisquick (http://gisquick.org) is an open source **geospatial data
publishing platform** developed for rapid sharing `QGIS
<http://qgis.org>`__ projects on the web.

Gisquick provides responsive web design, legend, or identification
possibilities. It allows creating topics from layers list, adding base
and overlay layers, attribute table data filtering, measuring
coordinates, length or area, and handy project printing from
