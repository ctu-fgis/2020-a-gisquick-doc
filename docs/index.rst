Gisquick is an open source geospatial data publishing platform
developed for rapid sharing of `QGIS <http://qgis.org>`__ projects in
web.

Gisquick has been originally developed for `GIS.lab
<http://web.gislab.io>`__ system with aim to produce generally usable
web client interface. Later it was separated into a new independent
project usable *with or without* GIS.lab infrastructure. It is how
Gisquick was born.

It provides responsive web design, legend, identification possibilities. 
It allows creating topics from layers list, adding base and overlay layers, 
attribute table data filtering, measuring coordinates, length or area
and handy project printing from web. 
 
To get the better idea what Gisquick is, see video below.
